- 👋 Hi, I’m @GrimKillingbeck ! Grim Killingbeck is a psuedonym that I use, but my name is Makeda DeJene. I'm a Software Engineer in training. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ...meeting other people on the same path, that love to practice coding and will maybe like to do body doubling so that we can get work/passion projects done!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I just finished learning intermediate HTML, and now I'm moving forward to CSS. I have a long way to go, but I am looking forward to the challenge!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...anything really! At some point, I'd like to branch out into UX Design, so that I can help make things more efficient/easier for others, especially folks with disabilities. 

- 📫 How to reach me ... I have a contact form on my github that goes straight to my email. Any constructive criticism is welcome!
